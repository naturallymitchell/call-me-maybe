# Mitchell's personal contact and support channel

As an open source developer with ongoing and past projects, I would like to thank the supporters and sponsors below for making my work possible.  Their names are also part of the projects I lead in `supporters.md` and `sponsors.md` files.

If you'd like to join my backers, then please pick one of the levels below.  If another payment method would work better for you, please open an issue and I'll set it up first.

If you have any feedback for me that doesn't fit any of the projects directly, you're welcomed to create an issue or join the [Found Patterns Studio Discord Server](https://discord.gg/f6XSuWs) and send me a message.

Since this is a new experiment for me, please take any details as temporary, since large changes might come.  (Note: If you ever want a refund for the current month, I'll do so, no questions asked.)
